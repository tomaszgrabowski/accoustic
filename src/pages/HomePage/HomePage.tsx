                Hello guys!
            </p>
            <p>
                So I managed to find some time for this task and now I wanted to share it with You.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was some real fun for me. I even managed to learn how to use Enzyme and combine my own hooks!
            </p>
            <p>
                Either way, I get something out of this process... ;)
            </p>

export default HomePage;
